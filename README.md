:rocket:  Project 2 for STA2453 at University of Toronto, 2020 - 2021  

:clipboard: A data dashboard that visualizes various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic in canada, including prevalence of the disease, status on vaccine rollout, reports on residents' mobility changes, and air travel flow-map. 

Unfortunately this dashboard is not hosted on any external server. However, the two files in this repo (along with a working RStudio app) will allow users to locally serve the dashboard with the most up-to-date data. :sparkles:
