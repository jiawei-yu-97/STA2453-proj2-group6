:rocket:  Project 2 for STA2453 at University of Toronto, 2020 - 2021  

:clipboard: A data dashboard that visualizes various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic in canada, including prevalence of the disease, status on vaccine rollout, reports on residents' mobility changes, and air travel flow-map. 

Unfortunately this dashboard is not hosted on any external server. <br>
To locally serve the dashboard with the most up-to-date data, simply download and open `covid_dashboard_shiny_app.R` in [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), and click the "run" button. :sparkles: <br>
Note that you don't need local copies of other files in this repo. `covid_dashboard_shiny_app.R` is all you need.
